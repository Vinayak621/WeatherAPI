# WeatherAPI
A website displaying Date, Time, Humidity, Pressure,  Wind Speed,  Sunrise, Sunset and the predicted weather data for the following days of the week, created using HTML,CSS and javascript. 
We access the location coordinates(latitude and longitude) using navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition method.
To fetch the weather data, I've made use of the Openweathermap API, One Call API 3.0 particularly.
